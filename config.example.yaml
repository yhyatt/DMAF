# Face Recognition Settings
recognition:
  # Backend: "face_recognition" (dlib) or "insightface" (deep learning, RECOMMENDED)
  # RECOMMENDED: "insightface" - Phase D testing showed:
  #   - 0.0% false positive rate on unknown people (perfect stranger rejection)
  #   - 12x faster than face_recognition (99s vs 1413s on test set)
  #   - 77.5% same-person recall (vs 92.5% for face_recognition)
  # Trade-off: insightface is more conservative but prevents privacy violations
  backend: "insightface"

  # Matching threshold - lower = stricter matching
  # Optimal values from Phase D testing:
  #   insightface: 0.42 (0.0% FPR, 77.5% TPR)
  #   face_recognition: 0.55 (11.2% FPR, 92.5% TPR)
  tolerance: 0.42

  # Minimum face size in pixels (skip tiny faces)
  min_face_size_pixels: 80

  require_any_match: true

  # Upload if ANY whitelisted person appears (vs. requiring ALL)
  allow_multiple_people: true
